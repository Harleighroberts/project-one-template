  		<span class="farmerstext">We are dedicated to sourcing a model<br> that is not only good for farmers but is good for the industry as a whole. By building trust between us and our producers, and to offer stability and security to the matcha tea and protein producing communities we partner with. We recognize that it is the growers, not us, who determine the tea lovers potential and we are honored to work with producers who take such pride in their work.</span>
