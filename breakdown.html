		<p>ORGINS<br>Mad Matcha started from studying agriculture, farm practices, and sustainable business. Farmers were sought who who were committed to producing quality crops, and who earned a reputation among matcha tea and protein producers.</p>

		<p>FARMERS<br>We are dedicated to sourcing a model that is not only good for farmers but is good for the industry as a whole. By building trust between us and our producers, and to offer stability and security to the matcha tea and protein producing communities we partner with. We recognize that it is the growers, not us, who determine the tea lovers potential and we are honored to work with producers who take such pride in their work.</p>

		<p>PRODUCERS<br>Tea leaves come from Nisho, Japan which is known for its climate and nutrient rich soil. It will be grown on terraces underneath shade which help produces clorphil and its bright green color. Leaves are hand picked, steamed, and put through a drying process. Then put through mills to be ground into a fine powder mixed with a protein milk.</p>

		<p>QUALITY<br>We embody a focus on quality. It’s the result of hard work, experience, and persistence. We’re dedicated to refining every area of our craft, so that quality comes through in every container of Mad Matcha. By our mode of growing matcha leaves and the protein we make you are sure to get the best source of drink for your health.</p>
